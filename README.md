# mygopherhose

Parallel importer for mysqldumps.

## What

mygopherhose uses a dump produced by `mysqldump` and imports it trying to
parallelize INSERT statements.

From [benchmarks](#gcp-benchmarks), it seems to perform 3x faster on small
instances (should be even better on high end machines).

## Caveats

- tables are not locked
- does not support SETting things
- does not support stored procedures

**Use at your own risks in production.**

## Usage

```
mygopherhose [-h host] -u user -p [password] [-P port] [-d dbname] [-b bufsize] dumpfile
        -h defaults to 127.0.0.1
        -P defaults to 3306
        -b defaults to 10485760 bytes
        -d can be omitted is dump contains `USE DATABASE foo;` stanza
        -p if parameter is empty, password will be asked interactively
```

- üêë is displayed at each `CREATE TABLE` operation.
- ‚åõ is diplayed when all transactions for the current table have been sent to
  the buffered channel for processing
- a dot is displayed for each `INSERT` statement applied (those statements
  almost always contains several rows, see
  [`net_buffer_length`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_net-buffer-length))
